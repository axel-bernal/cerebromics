    "# Principle options for regression tools\n",
    "The object of our base regression tools is to provide an easy way to train and test models, automatically including standard covariates and properly handling cross validation issues. In many cases you can set up a regression test with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main items of documentation for the base regression tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The [tutorial notebook](http://10.6.39.8:8888/notebooks/ML%20-%20baseline%20regression%20and%20classification%20tools.ipynb) works through a series of examples of how these tools work, from a simple three line example to more complex configurations.\n",
    "2. There is a [notebook](http://10.6.39.8:8888/notebooks/Users/Peter/Sample2.ipynb) which uses these tools to generate our production eye color models.\n",
    "3. There is [online API documentation.](http://jarvis.hli.io/~pgarst/datastack/datastack/)\n",
    "4. This notebook provides a brief summary of the principle methods and options as a quick reference for those already familiar with the basic ideas."
